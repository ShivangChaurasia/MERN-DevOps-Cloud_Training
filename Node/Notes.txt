---------------------------------------------------------------
Frontend vs Backend:
---------------------------------------------------------------

Frontend:
- The frontend is the part of a web application that users interact with directly. It includes everything that users see and experience in their web browsers,
    such as the layout, design, and user interface elements.
- Frontend development typically involves technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks and libraries
    such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- The main focus of frontend development is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that allows users to interact 
    with the application effectively.

Backend:
- The backend is the part of a web application that runs on the server and is responsible for processing requests,
    managing data, and performing business logic.
- Backend development typically involves programming languages such as Node.js,
    Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP, along with frameworks like Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring, or Laravel.
- The main focus of backend development is to ensure that the application functions correctly,
    handles data efficiently, and provides the necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with.
- The backend is also responsible for tasks such as authentication, authorization, database management,
    and server-side rendering.

---------------------------------------------------------------

What is Server?
- A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
- Servers can host websites, manage databases, handle email, and perform various other tasks depending on their configuration and purpose.
- In the context of web development, a server typically refers to a web server that processes incoming requests from clients (such as web browsers)
    and responds with the appropriate content, such as HTML pages, images, or data in JSON format.
- Servers can be physical machines or virtual instances running in the cloud, and they often run server-side software to handle requests and manage
    resources efficiently.

    Exaple with Node.js:
    - In a Node.js application, the server is created using the built-in 'http' module or frameworks like Express.js.
        The server listens for incoming requests on a specified port and responds with the appropriate data or content.


---------------------------------------------------------------

What is Client?

- A client is a computer or software application that accesses services or resources provided by a server over a network.
- In the context of web development, a client typically refers to a web browser or any application
    that sends requests to a web server and receives responses, such as HTML pages, images, or data in JSON format.
- Clients can be used to access various types of services, including websites, APIs, databases, and more.
- The client initiates communication with the server by sending requests, and the server processes those requests and returns the appropriate responses.

    Example with Node.js:
    - In a Node.js application, the client can be a web browser that sends HTTP requests to the server created using Node.js.
        The server processes these requests and responds with the requested content, such as HTML pages or JSON data.


---------------------------------------------------------------

3-layer Architecture:
- The 3-layer architecture, also known as the three-tier architecture, is a software design pattern that separates an application into three
    distinct layers:
    1. the presentation layer
    2. the business logic/Application layer
    3. the data access layer.
- The presentation layer is responsible for handling the user interface and user interactions. It is the layer that users
    interact with directly.
- The business logic layer contains the core functionality and logic of the application. It processes data,
    performs calculations, and implements the rules of the application.
- The data access layer is responsible for managing the interaction with the database or any other data storage.
    It handles data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.

    Example with Node.js:
    - In a Node.js application, the presentation layer could be implemented using a frontend framework like
    React or Angular, while the business logic layer could be implemented using Node.js and Express.js to handle the server-side logic.
    The data access layer could be implemented using a database like MongoDB or MySQL, with Node.js handling the database interactions
    through an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) or direct database queries.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Client-Server Model:
- The client-server model is a distributed application architecture that divides tasks between clients and servers.
- In this model, clients are responsible for initiating requests and consuming services, while servers are responsible for processing requests and providing
    responses.
- The client-server model allows for a clear separation of concerns, where clients focus on the user interface and user experience,
    while servers handle the business logic and data management.
- This model is widely used in web development, where web browsers (clients) interact with web servers to access websites and services.

    Example with Node.js:
    - In a Node.js application, the client could be a web browser that sends HTTP requests to a Node.js server. The server processes these requests,
        performs the necessary business logic, and responds with the appropriate content, such as HTML pages or JSON data. This interaction follows the client-server model,
        where the client initiates communication and the server responds accordingly.


----------------------------------------------------------------

V8 Engine: C++
- The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is used
    in Google Chrome and Node.js to execute JavaScript code.
- The V8 engine compiles JavaScript code into machine code, which allows for faster execution
    compared to interpreting JavaScript code directly.
- The V8 engine includes features such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, garbage
    collection, and optimization techniques to improve the performance of JavaScript applications.
- In Node.js, the V8 engine is responsible for executing JavaScript code on the server
    and provides the runtime environment for Node.js applications to run efficiently.

    Example with Node.js:
    - When you run a Node.js application, the V8 engine compiles and executes the JavaScript code, allowing your server-side application to perform tasks such as handling HTTP requests,
        managing databases, and processing data efficiently.

----------------------------------------------------------------


libuv: C
- libuv is a multi-platform support library that provides an event-driven, asynchronous I/O model
    for Node.js. It is responsible for handling asynchronous operations such as file system access, network communication, and timers.
- libuv abstracts away the differences between operating systems and provides a consistent API for performing asynchronous operations
    across different platforms.
- In Node.js, libuv is used to manage the event loop and handle asynchronous tasks,
    allowing Node.js applications to perform non-blocking I/O operations efficiently.
- libuv is a crucial component of Node.js that enables it to handle a large number of
    concurrent connections and perform I/O operations without blocking the main thread.

    Example with Node.js:
    - When you perform an asynchronous operation in a Node.js application, such as reading a file or making an HTTP request, libuv manages the event loop and ensures that the operation is executed without blocking the main thread,
        allowing your application to remain responsive and efficient even when handling multiple concurrent operations.

============================================================================================================
File System:
============================================================================================================

- The file system is a way of organizing and storing files on a computer or server.
    It provides a hierarchical structure for managing files and directories, allowing users and applications to create, read, write, and manipulate files.
- In Node.js, the 'fs' module provides an API for interacting with the file system, allowing you to read, write, and manipulate files and directories.
- The 'fs' module provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for performing file operations,
    allowing you to choose the appropriate approach based on your application's needs.

- There are two main types of file operations in Node.js:
1. Synchronous file operations: These operations block the execution of the program until the operation is completed. They are typically used for simple tasks or when you need to ensure that a file operation is completed before proceeding with the next step in your code.
2. Asynchronous file operations: These operations do not block the execution of the program and allow other tasks to run concurrently while the file operation is being performed. They are typically used for more complex tasks or when you want to improve the performance of your application by allowing it to handle multiple operations simultaneously.

    Example with Node.js (Asynchronous file operations):
    - To read a file asynchronously using the 'fs' module in Node.js, you can use the 'fs.readFile' method, which takes a callback function that is called when the file has been read:
        ```javascript
        const fs = require('fs');

        fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
            if (err) {
                console.error(err);
                return;
            }
            console.log(data);
        });
        ```
    - To write to a file asynchronously using the 'fs' module, you can use the 'fs.writeFile' method, which also takes a callback function that is called when the file has been written:
        ```javascript
        const fs = require('fs');
        fs.writeFile('example.txt', 'Hello, World!', 'utf8', (err) => {
            if (err) {
                console.error(err);
                return;
            }
            console.log('File has been written successfully!');
        });
        ```
    - To append to a file asynchronously using the 'fs' module, you can use the 'fs.appendFile' method, which also takes a callback function that is called when the file has been appended:
        ```javascript
        const fs = require('fs');
        fs.appendFile('example.txt', '\nThis is an appended line.', 'utf8', (err) => {
            if (err) {
                console.error(err);
                return;
            }
            console.log('File has been appended successfully!');
        });
        ```

    Example with Node.js (Synchronous file operations):
    - To read a file synchronously using the 'fs' module in Node.js, you can use the 'fs.readFileSync' method, which returns the contents of the file:
        ```javascript
        const fs = require('fs');
        try {
            const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
            console.log(data);
        } catch (err) {
            console.error(err);
        }
        ```
    - To write to a file synchronously using the 'fs' module, you can use the 'fs.writeFileSync' method, which writes data to the file:
        ```javascript
        const fs = require('fs');
        try {
            fs.writeFileSync('example.txt', 'Hello, World!', 'utf8');
            console.log('File has been written successfully!');
        } catch (err) {
            console.error(err);
        }
        ```
    - To append to a file synchronously using the 'fs' module, you can use the 'fs.appendFileSync' method, which appends data to the file:
        ```javascript
        const fs = require('fs');
        try {
            fs.appendFileSync('example.txt', '\nThis is an appended line.', 'utf8');
            console.log('File has been appended successfully!');
        } catch (err) {
            console.error(err);
        }
        ```

=====================================================================
http Module: (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
=====================================================================

- The 'http' module in Node.js is a built-in module that allows you to create HTTP servers and make HTTP requests.
- The 'http' module provides methods for handling HTTP requests and responses, allowing you to build web servers and interact with web services.
- The 'http' module can be used to create a simple web server that listens for incoming HTTP requests and responds with the appropriate content, such as HTML pages or JSON data.

    Example with Node.js:
    - To create a simple HTTP server using the 'http' module in Node.js, you can use the following code:
        ```javascript
        const http = require('http');

        const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
            res.statusCode = 200;
            res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
            res.end('Hello, World!');
        });

        server.listen(3000, () => {
            console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
        });
        ```
    - In this example, we create an HTTP server that listens on port 3000. When a request is received, the server responds with a status code of 200 (OK), sets the content type to 'text/plain', and sends the response body 'Hello, World!'.

    - To make an HTTP request using the 'http' module in Node.js, you can use the following code:
        ```javascript
        const http = require('http');

        const options = {
            hostname: 'www.example.com',
            port: 80,
        }
        const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
            console.log(`Status Code: ${res.statusCode}`);

            res.on('data', (chunk) => {
                console.log(`Body: ${chunk}`);
            });
        });

Frontend vs Backend:
---------------------------------------------------------------

Frontend:
- The frontend is the part of a web application that users interact with directly. It includes everything that users see and experience in their web browsers,
    such as the layout, design, and user interface elements.
- Frontend development typically involves technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks and libraries
    such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- The main focus of frontend development is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that allows users to interact 
    with the application effectively.

Backend:
- The backend is the part of a web application that runs on the server and is responsible for processing requests,
    managing data, and performing business logic.
- Backend development typically involves programming languages such as Node.js,
    Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP, along with frameworks like Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring, or Laravel.
- The main focus of backend development is to ensure that the application functions correctly,
    handles data efficiently, and provides the necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with.
- The backend is also responsible for tasks such as authentication, authorization, database management,
    and server-side rendering.

---------------------------------------------------------------

What is Server?
- A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
- Servers can host websites, manage databases, handle email, and perform various other tasks depending on their configuration and purpose.
- In the context of web development, a server typically refers to a web server that processes incoming requests from clients (such as web browsers)
    and responds with the appropriate content, such as HTML pages, images, or data in JSON format.
- Servers can be physical machines or virtual instances running in the cloud, and they often run server-side software to handle requests and manage
    resources efficiently.

    Exaple with Node.js:
    - In a Node.js application, the server is created using the built-in 'http' module or frameworks like Express.js.
        The server listens for incoming requests on a specified port and responds with the appropriate data or content.


---------------------------------------------------------------

What is Client?

- A client is a computer or software application that accesses services or resources provided by a server over a network.
- In the context of web development, a client typically refers to a web browser or any application
    that sends requests to a web server and receives responses, such as HTML pages, images, or data in JSON format.
- Clients can be used to access various types of services, including websites, APIs, databases, and more.
- The client initiates communication with the server by sending requests, and the server processes those requests and returns the appropriate responses.

    Example with Node.js:
    - In a Node.js application, the client can be a web browser that sends HTTP requests to the server created using Node.js.
        The server processes these requests and responds with the requested content, such as HTML pages or JSON data.


---------------------------------------------------------------

3-layer Architecture:
- The 3-layer architecture, also known as the three-tier architecture, is a software design pattern that separates an application into three
    distinct layers:
    1. the presentation layer
    2. the business logic/Application layer
    3. the data access layer.
- The presentation layer is responsible for handling the user interface and user interactions. It is the layer that users
    interact with directly.
- The business logic layer contains the core functionality and logic of the application. It processes data,
    performs calculations, and implements the rules of the application.
- The data access layer is responsible for managing the interaction with the database or any other data storage.
    It handles data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.

    Example with Node.js:
    - In a Node.js application, the presentation layer could be implemented using a frontend framework like
    React or Angular, while the business logic layer could be implemented using Node.js and Express.js to handle the server-side logic.
    The data access layer could be implemented using a database like MongoDB or MySQL, with Node.js handling the database interactions
    through an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) or direct database queries.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Client-Server Model:
- The client-server model is a distributed application architecture that divides tasks between clients and servers.
- In this model, clients are responsible for initiating requests and consuming services, while servers are responsible for processing requests and providing
    responses.
- The client-server model allows for a clear separation of concerns, where clients focus on the user interface and user experience,
    while servers handle the business logic and data management.
- This model is widely used in web development, where web browsers (clients) interact with web servers to access websites and services.

    Example with Node.js:
    - In a Node.js application, the client could be a web browser that sends HTTP requests to a Node.js server. The server processes these requests,
        performs the necessary business logic, and responds with the appropriate content, such as HTML pages or JSON data. This interaction follows the client-server model,
        where the client initiates communication and the server responds accordingly.

Frontend vs Backend:
---------------------------------------------------------------

Frontend:
- The frontend is the part of a web application that users interact with directly. It includes everything that users see and experience in their web browsers,
    such as the layout, design, and user interface elements.
- Frontend development typically involves technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks and libraries
    such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- The main focus of frontend development is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that allows users to interact 
    with the application effectively.

Backend:
- The backend is the part of a web application that runs on the server and is responsible for processing requests,
    managing data, and performing business logic.
- Backend development typically involves programming languages such as Node.js,
    Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP, along with frameworks like Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring, or Laravel.
- The main focus of backend development is to ensure that the application functions correctly,
    handles data efficiently, and provides the necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with.
- The backend is also responsible for tasks such as authentication, authorization, database management,
    and server-side rendering.

What is Server?
- A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
- Servers can host websites, manage databases, handle email, and perform various other tasks depending on their configuration and purpose.
- In the context of web development, a server typically refers to a web server that processes incoming requests from clients (such as web browsers)
    and responds with the appropriate content, such as HTML pages, images, or data in JSON format.
- Servers can be physical machines or virtual instances running in the cloud, and they often run server-side software to handle requests and manage
    resources efficiently.

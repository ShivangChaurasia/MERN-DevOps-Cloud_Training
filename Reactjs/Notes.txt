What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page (SPA) applications where you need a
fast, interactive user experience. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.
Uses virtual DOM concept to optimize rendering performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.

Declarative vs Imperative:
Declarative programming is a style of building programs that expresses the logic of computation without describing its control flow. 
In contrast, imperative programming requires developers to explicitly define the steps the computer must take to achieve a desired outcome.
React follows the declarative programming paradigm, allowing developers to describe what the UI should look like for a given state,
and React takes care of updating the DOM to match that state.
Table:
| Aspect               | Declarative Programming                     | Imperative Programming                      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Focus                | What the program should accomplish          | How the program should accomplish it        |
| Control Flow        | Abstracted away, handled by the framework   | Explicitly defined by the developer         |
| Readability         | Generally more readable and easier to understand | Can be harder to read due to detailed control flow  |
| Maintenance        | Easier to maintain and refactor             | Can become complex and harder to maintain over time |

Library vs Framework:
A library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to optimize tasks. It provides specific functionality that can be called upon as needed.
A framework, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive solution that provides a structure for building applications. It often dictates the architecture and flow of the application.
React is considered a library because it focuses specifically on building user interfaces and does not impose a specific architecture on the application.

Is React a framework or a library?
React is a library, not a framework. It is primarily concerned with the view layer of an application and does not provide a
full-fledged framework for building applications like Angular or Vue.js.
Table:
| Aspect               | Library                                    | Framework                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Control              | Developer calls the library as needed      | Framework calls the developer's code         |
| Scope                | Focused on specific functionality          | Provides a complete structure for applications|
| Flexibility         | More flexible, can be integrated with other libraries | Less flexible, often requires adherence to its structure |
| Learning Curve      | Generally easier to learn due to focused scope | Can be steeper due to comprehensive nature          |

SSR (Server-Side Rendering) vs CSR (Client-Side Rendering):
SSR (Server-Side Rendering) is a technique where the server generates the full HTML for a page and sends it to the client.
CSR (Client-Side Rendering) is a technique where the client (browser) generates the HTML for a page using JavaScript after the initial page load.
Table:
| Aspect               | Server-Side Rendering (SSR)                               | Client-Side Rendering (CSR)                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Initial Load Time   | Faster initial load, as HTML is pre-rendered on the server | Slower initial load, as HTML is generated on the client |
| SEO                 | Better for SEO, as content is available in the initial HTML | Can be less SEO-friendly, as content is generated via JavaScript |
| Interactivity      | May require additional client-side JavaScript for interactivity | Interactivity is built-in as the client generates the HTML |
| Server Load        | Higher server load, as server generates HTML for each request | Lower server load, as client handles rendering after initial load |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Components:
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that define how a certain part of the UI should appear and behave.
Components can be functional or class-based, with functional components being the more modern and preferred approach in recent React development.

JSX (JavaScript XML):
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize the structure of the UI.
JSX is transpiled to regular JavaScript by tools like Babel before being executed in the browser
